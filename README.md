# How do I use it?

`./editor.py initial.config` is probably a good place to start. Note
that you autosave if there are no conflicts.

- `qweasd`: Translate current piece.
- `p`: Reorient primary axis (cycles the piece X axis through the 6
  cardinal directions)
- `l`: Reorient secondary axis (rotate piece about its X axis, sort of)
- `TAB` and backtick: Change selected piece.
